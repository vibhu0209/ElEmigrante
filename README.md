# El Emigrante

## Game Overview

**El Emigrante** is a 2D infinite runner inspired by the struggles and hopes of Mexican migrants crossing the U.S. border. You play as a Mexican man known as "El Emigrante"—a brave soul who has crossed into America seeking freedom and opportunity, but is relentlessly pursued by police. Move in both X and Y directions, dodge the ever-chasing patrol cars, and survive as long as possible to increase your score. The longer you evade capture, the greater your accomplishments—but every choice along the way is a sacrifice, echoing the costs many migrants face.

### Theme: Sacrifice Must Be Made

This game explores the theme of *sacrifice*: to escape and find a better life, El Emigrante makes difficult choices and endures constant risk. Sometimes you must surrender safety, points, or power-ups to survive—the game challenges you to weigh every move for your shot at freedom.
